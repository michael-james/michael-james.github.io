          my story
        </h1>
        <p>
          My work engages play, empathy, and analytics to devise solutions to wicked problems. I spend time with people, tools, materials, and ideas until I know their truth. Then I use these discoveries to create human-centered services and environments, with an eye towards emerging technologies such as machine learning, VR &amp; AR, and ambient displays. I have found my dramatic practice as a storyteller and creative constantly informs the moments I orchestrate throughout my work.
        </p>
        <p>
          At <a href="http://cmu.edu" target="_blank">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, I study <a href="http://drama.cmu.edu/programs/undergraduate/video-media-design/" target="_blank">Video &amp; Media Design</a> in the School of Drama and <a href="https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Human-Computer Interaction</a> in the School of Computer Science. I've done research with <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mklee/" target="_blank">Min Kyung Lee</a> on services for the homeless and <a href="http://kittur.org/" target="_blank">Niki Kittur</a> &amp; <a href="http://jeffrz.com/" target="_blank">Jeff Rzeszotarski</a> on the touch-based data visualization tool <a href="http://datasquid.co/" target="_blank">Data Squid</a>.

        <p>
          Last summer, I worked as a UX Design Intern at <a href="https://www.procore.com/" target="_blank">Procore Technologies</a>, a leader in construction management software, to redesign aspects of the implementation and onboarding process for new accounts. I collaborated closely with Sales &amp; Customer Success to create seamless frontstage and backstage interactions. I also redesigned the architecture of the platform's menu system and lay the groundwork for an Amazon Echo integration.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've designed and created multiple dramatic works, including most recently <i>Milk Like Sugar</i> at CMU. I'm the Associate Director for Design &amp; Curation at <a href="http://roundroomimage.org/live" target="_blank">Round Room Image</a>, where I've collaborated on <i>Surrounded</i> and <i>Surrounded 2.0</i> (the latter was devised in Scotland and presented at the Prague Quadrennial).
        </p>
        <p>
          In my work with the <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/slice/studentactivities/leadership/clc.html" target="_blank">Carnegie Leadership Consultants</a>, I've created multiple workshops to educate the student community about leadership and help individual organization's align with their goals. I'm a member of CMU's <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/dean/impaqt/index.html" target="_blank">IMPAQT program</a>, which establishes meaningful ties between the Pittsburgh and Qatar campuses.
