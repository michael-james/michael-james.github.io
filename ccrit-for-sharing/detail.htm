      <p>The Barrio Logan 2013 Community Plan first describes its goals for mobility within the Barrio Logan neighborhood. It then describes the current state of walkability and some challenges for pedestrians in Barrio Logan, defines the concept of “complete streets,” and finally lists its recommended walkability policies.

        <blockquote>
          <h3>3.1 Walkability.</h3>
          <p>Barrio Logan has several important features of a walkable community including its fine-grained mix of residential and neighborhood serving commercial uses in the village area and basic grid network of streets throughout. Walking is commonplace in Barrio Logan and sidewalks exist on virtually all streets. Deficiencies in the pedestrian environment include the barriers presented by the rail and freeway infrastructure, large land parcels, industrial uses interspersed throughout the neighborhood, and inadequate sidewalks and pedestrian facilities on higher pedestrian and traffic volume streets. Pedestrian routes in Barrio Logan have been classified based on definitions in the City’s Pedestrian Master Plan and are shown in Figure 3-1, Pedestrian Routes.</p>
          <p>The Mobility Element promotes the concept of Complete Streets in which roadways are designed and operated to enable safe, attractive, and comfortable access and travel for all users. Pedestrians, bicyclists, motorists and public transport users of all ages and abilities are able to safely and comfortably move along and across a complete street. Complete streets create a sense of place and improve social interaction and may include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Sidewalks and buffer areas</li>
            <li>Bicycle lanes</li>
            <li>Well designed and well placed crosswalks</li>
            <li>Raised crosswalks, medians or crossing islands in appropriate midblock locations</li>
            <li>Special bus lanes</li>
            <li>Accessible pedestrian signals</li>
            <li>Sidewalk bulb-outs</li>
            <li>Street trees, planter strips and ground cover, staggered parking, and other ‘traffic calming’ techniques which tend to lower speeds and define an edge to travel ways</li>
            <li>Center medians with trees and ground cover</li>
            <li>Reduction in numbers of driveway</li>
          </ul>

          <p>All recommended improvements in the Mobility Element were developed with consideration of implementing complete streets. General Plan policies ME-A.6 through ME-A.9 as well as the Traffic Calming Toolbox, Tables ME-1 and ME- 2, should be consulted for additional policies.</p>

          <h4>WALKABILITY POLICIES</h4>
          <p><strong>Policy 3.1.1</strong> Support and promote complete sidewalk and intersection improvements along Harbor Drive including the intersections at: Sampson Street, Cesar E. Chavez Parkway, Schley Street, 28th Street and 32nd Street.</p>

      <p>The City of San Diego Street Design Manual describes how walking in a city is often complicated by traffic, low quality paving, and lack of adequate lighting, when it should be pleasant and relaxing. It lays out guidelines for improving the pedestrian experience at street level, from designing for various disabilities to providing safe street crossings.
        <a role="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#quote6" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="collapseOne">(see original text)</a>
      </p>

      <div id="quote6" class="panel-collapse collapse" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="headingOne">
        <blockquote>
          <p>The 1979 Progress Guide and General Plan states that walking within an urban community should be a pleasant and enjoyable experience, an opportunity for healthful exercise and quiet relaxation on the way to work, shopping, or other destinations. Instead, the pedestrian must often contend with annoying vehicular noise and fumes from the adjacent street, narrow and irregular sidewalk surfaces, and a veritable obstacle course of poles, fire hydrants, and trash containers within the public walkway. Additionally, adequate street lighting for nighttime safety is often lacking, especially at bus stops. Moreover, amenities such as shade trees, landscaping, and comfortable seating areas are infrequently provided in commercial districts where walking is the normal transportation mode.</p>
          <p>The principal issue in the design of a pedestrian-supportive street is how to allocate its space; i.e.: How much space is required to satisfy the needs of pedestrians; how much to create active public space for deliveries; and, how much to provide for parking, bicycles, and vehicular movement?</p>
          <p>The following discusses the pedestrian experience at street level, including street design, intersection design, sight distance, pedestrian crossings, pedestrian refuge islands, sidewalks for overpasses and underpasses and highway on/off ramps, and pedestrian realm:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Understanding ADA &amp; Designing for Various Disabilities and Ages - It is essential, however, the design of pedestrian facilities take into account the abilities and disabilities of ALL pedestrians. Mobility impairment is but one classification of disability, along with sensory deficits (the sight and hearing impaired) and cognitive impairments—those with diminished ability to process information, including language barriers.</li>
            <li>Street Design - At a site and detail design level, the design of streets must consider the mobility and safety of the pedestrian ensuring that maximizing traffic capacity and speeds are not the dominant consideration in street design, particularly in pedestrian-oriented areas.</li>
            <li>Intersection Design and Operations - The word “intersection” means more than just the meeting of two (or more) streets. It is the where the auto realm and the pedestrian realm converge, sometimes in conflict. It is because of this that intersections are often the most vital areas along a street notwithstanding that they are the point of most conflicts between vehicles, pedestrians, and bicycles. Intersections must be designed with pedestrian safety and accessibility in mind. If pedestrians are either prohibited from crossing or discouraged from crossing, walking as a mode of travel is hampered. The spacing of intersections or crossing points is also an important element in the creation of a supportive pedestrian environment.</li>
            <li>Sight Distance - More often than not, sight distance is discussed only from the standpoint of the driver and not the pedestrian. This is of particular concern at crosswalk locations where parked cars, utility poles, street furnishing or landscape can obstruct the line of sight for pedestrians.</li>
            <li>Pedestrian Crossings - One of the most effective means of turning an important corridor into a community “spine” or “seam” rather than a “divider” is providing for safe street crossings. </li>
            <li>Pedestrian Refuge Islands - Pedestrian refuges in wide or busy streets improve safety for pedestrians and vehicles. They are defined as areas within an intersection or between lanes of traffic where pedestrians may safely walk until vehicular traffic clears, allowing them to cross a street. Another benefit to pedestrians is that it can significantly reduce delay in crossing unsignalized intersections since the pedestrian need only search for vehicles in one direction at a time.</li>
            <li>Creating a Pedestrian Realm- Safe and direct sidewalk connections are of key importance to creating a pedestrian-friendly environment. Sidewalks should support activities that will occur in the area and provide a comfortable place for pedestrians to take part in various activities. However, creating a high quality pedestrian realm that supports and encourages walking takes much more than simply providing sidewalks. The design of the sidewalk and the elements within it and the location and design of buildings are just some of the additional considerations of creating a pedestrian-supportive environment. Furthermore, walking provides more opportunities to observe details than any other Pedestrian Design Pd 74 form of transport. Landscape and architectural details are necessary, therefore, to sustain interest for the pedestrians as well as to provide a safe and comfortable experience.</li>
