        <blockquote>
          <p>The 1979 Progress Guide and General Plan states that walking within an urban community should be a pleasant and enjoyable experience, an opportunity for healthful exercise and quiet relaxation on the way to work, shopping, or other destinations. Instead, the pedestrian must often contend with annoying vehicular noise and fumes from the adjacent street, narrow and irregular sidewalk surfaces, and a veritable obstacle course of poles, fire hydrants, and trash containers within the public walkway. Additionally, adequate street lighting for nighttime safety is often lacking, especially at bus stops. Moreover, amenities such as shade trees, landscaping, and comfortable seating areas are infrequently provided in commercial districts where walking is the normal transportation mode.</p>
          <p>The principal issue in the design of a pedestrian-supportive street is how to allocate its space; i.e.: How much space is required to satisfy the needs of pedestrians; how much to create active public space for deliveries; and, how much to provide for parking, bicycles, and vehicular movement?</p>
          <p>The following discusses the pedestrian experience at street level, including street design, intersection design, sight distance, pedestrian crossings, pedestrian refuge islands, sidewalks for overpasses and underpasses and highway on/off ramps, and pedestrian realm:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Understanding ADA &amp; Designing for Various Disabilities and Ages - It is essential, however, the design of pedestrian facilities take into account the abilities and disabilities of ALL pedestrians. Mobility impairment is but one classification of disability, along with sensory deficits (the sight and hearing impaired) and cognitive impairments—those with diminished ability to process information, including language barriers.</li>
            <li>Street Design - At a site and detail design level, the design of streets must consider the mobility and safety of the pedestrian ensuring that maximizing traffic capacity and speeds are not the dominant consideration in street design, particularly in pedestrian-oriented areas.</li>
            <li>Intersection Design and Operations - The word “intersection” means more than just the meeting of two (or more) streets. It is the where the auto realm and the pedestrian realm converge, sometimes in conflict. It is because of this that intersections are often the most vital areas along a street notwithstanding that they are the point of most conflicts between vehicles, pedestrians, and bicycles. Intersections must be designed with pedestrian safety and accessibility in mind. If pedestrians are either prohibited from crossing or discouraged from crossing, walking as a mode of travel is hampered. The spacing of intersections or crossing points is also an important element in the creation of a supportive pedestrian environment.</li>
            <li>Sight Distance - More often than not, sight distance is discussed only from the standpoint of the driver and not the pedestrian. This is of particular concern at crosswalk locations where parked cars, utility poles, street furnishing or landscape can obstruct the line of sight for pedestrians.</li>
            <li>Pedestrian Crossings - One of the most effective means of turning an important corridor into a community “spine” or “seam” rather than a “divider” is providing for safe street crossings. </li>
            <li>Pedestrian Refuge Islands - Pedestrian refuges in wide or busy streets improve safety for pedestrians and vehicles. They are defined as areas within an intersection or between lanes of traffic where pedestrians may safely walk until vehicular traffic clears, allowing them to cross a street. Another benefit to pedestrians is that it can significantly reduce delay in crossing unsignalized intersections since the pedestrian need only search for vehicles in one direction at a time.</li>
            <li>Creating a Pedestrian Realm- Safe and direct sidewalk connections are of key importance to creating a pedestrian-friendly environment. Sidewalks should support activities that will occur in the area and provide a comfortable place for pedestrians to take part in various activities. However, creating a high quality pedestrian realm that supports and encourages walking takes much more than simply providing sidewalks. The design of the sidewalk and the elements within it and the location and design of buildings are just some of the additional considerations of creating a pedestrian-supportive environment. Furthermore, walking provides more opportunities to observe details than any other Pedestrian Design Pd 74 form of transport. Landscape and architectural details are necessary, therefore, to sustain interest for the pedestrians as well as to provide a safe and comfortable experience.</li>

          <p><h3>Green Streets</h3>The Downtown Community Plan (DCP) emphasizes “public realm” enhancement that includes designated Green Streets envisioned as an essential element and integral to the open space system – as connectors to the waterfront, Balboa Park, downtown activity centers proposed parks and plazas, and as continuous recreational bicycle paths. Centre City Green, downtown’s sustainability plan, defines Green Streets as employing sustainable landscape elements, such as energy efficient street lights, storm water management, multi-modal transportation choices, and widened sidewalks bordering tree-lined open spaces.

            <li>Abundant vegetation to provide shade, clean stormwater runoff, and improve air quality </li>
            <li>Facilities and furnishings to foster use of the sidewalk as a community space and a marketplace </li>
