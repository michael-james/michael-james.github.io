                  <p>So with these green streets, the idea is to expand the public right of way on one side of the street. You’re taking that 15-foot sidewalk and you’re pushing it out into the public right of way an additional 14-16 feet, so you have possible a 30-foot pedestrian area for people to go up and down. The green streets are all about pedestrian orientation, about getting ways for people to walk…</p>

                  <p>But if you’re able to see all the way down to this portion of MTS, with a park and all the people going in and out, and from here, you’re able to see into Barrio Logan, into the Mercato, you’d have guideways and a temptation to go down the Promenade. and encourage them to walk the full length of 14th street, because otherwise, with such a long stretch, it might be discouraging. But if there’s activity, then they’ll want to go to the next block, then the next block, and get people engaged along all the different neighborhoods throughout downtown and into Barrio Logan and vice versa.</p>

                  <p>This is really about creating a more celebratory either entrance or connection [between East Village and Barrio Logan] so people have a very comfortable walking experience, which will hopefully really encourage more visitation and enjoyment of the community.</p>
