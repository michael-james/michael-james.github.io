      <h3>Continuous Promenade Elements</h3>
      <p>
        Uniting the three districts, are features that are continuous throughout the Promenade. These include the following:
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Planting</b> <span class="label label-primary">Recommended for You</span> – although district plant palettes differ, the 14th Street Promenade will feature additional canopy trees and low growing, low water-use, low maintenance, colorful understory plantings. The planting plan will dominate the corridor creating an inviting space for a variety of uses, yet allowing visual access to the Promenade for policing and easy access for maintenance. Plantings on the east side of the street will occur mostly in the furnishing zone, keeping the thru-way zone clear for pedestrian traffic. Plantings in the frontage zone are encouraged on both sides of the street.</li>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Street Trees</b> - proposed street trees will conform to all requirements in the Streetscape Manual. Additional trees are listed in the individual district plant palettes and will be used as accent to the dominant street tree. Canopy trees will comprise a majority of the Promenade planting, creating shade and a green oasis. Trees will be located in the furnishing zone and at specific locations as shown on the plans.
        <li><b>Parking Lot Screening</b> – plants located in the frontage zone will provide a green visual buffer at surface parking lots. Plants should be a combination of canopy trees and low growing shrubs in order to maintain sight lines.</li>
        <li><b>Plantings in the Frontage Zone</b> – opportunities for plantings should be provided , where possible, between the building’s set back and/or entrance and the public right-of-way. These areas provide visual interest, integrate the architecture with the pedestrian zone, may be used for wayfinding, and may also be developed to manage storm water runoff. </li>
        <li><b>Hanging Baskets and Planters</b> – accent plantings in hanging baskets or planters offer an opportunity to incorporate plants in existing right-of-ways where there is limited space for planting. Planters should be located in the frontage zone adjacent to building facades. Hanging baskets may be located on street lights poles in the furnishing zone. Planters in the furnishing zone will be evaluated on a case by case basis. 
        <li><b>Green Walls</b> – green walls are a means of adding plants in areas with limited space and can be used to create a dramatic vertical design element.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="pad">
        <img class="pad" height="193" src="assets/streettrees.jpg">
        <img class="pad" height="193" src="assets/screening.jpg">
        <img class="pad" height="193" src="assets/frontage1.jpg">
        <img class="pad" height="193" src="assets/frontage2.jpg">

        <img class="pad" height="193" src="assets/greenwalls.jpg">
      </div>

      <p>
        <b>Paving</b> – concrete walkways and decomposed granite paths will comprise a common ground plane along the 14th Street Promenade. Concrete walkways will be located in the frontage and thru-way zone with the decomposed granite path located in the furnishing zone. Existing improved sidewalks will remain throughout the streetscape. The addition of the Promenade will protect in place these existing sidewalks, and the new trail and amenities, where applicable, will extend from the back of the existing curb into the public right-of-way. In areas where the sidewalk has not been improved, the sidewalk shall follow the guidelines in the Streetscape Manual for color and pattern and the new trail and amenities will become integral to the overall design of the pedestrian realm. 
      <p>

      <h3>West Side 14th Street Improvements</h3>
      <p>
        Proposed West Side Improvements are limited to porous paving for parking stalls, bulb outs at all corners per the Master Plan drawings, and hanging baskets supported form existing light poles.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Outdoor furniture</b> – the outdoor furniture shall be consistent throughout the promenade, yet opportunities exist to accent the public space with unique pieces.

          <li>
            <b>Wayfinding</b> – a means of informing the pedestrian to the location of other park and recreation facilities in the vicinity
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Gateway Elements</b> - San Diego has a history of providing unique gateway elements at a pedestrian scale that help to define neighborhoods. This design will continue that with that tradition by adding unique gateway elements that will define the three individual districts.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Building Signs</b> – creative signs on buildings are encourage to accent the pedestrian zone
          </li>

          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <b>Street Crossings and Pedestrian Safety</b> <span class="label label-primary">Recommended for You</span> – The design of the street crossings shall provide the maximum amount of security for the pedestrian. Bulb-outs are located at intersections to narrow the pedestrian crossing and shall be designed per the Streetscape Manual. Intersections shall have continental crosswalks to help define the pedestrian crossing.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Storm Water Treatment</b> – Bioswales will occur at locations throughout the promenade for storm water collection and cleansing.
        </p>
 
        <p>
          <b>Lighting</b> - Street Lights shall be provided per Streetscape Manual. Additional pedestrian lighting will be provided that complements existing lighting.
        </p>

        <p>

These opportunities will be implemented by and/or in association with the City’s Commission for Arts and Culture, as funding becomes available.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Interpretive Elements</b> – Opportunity exists throughout the corridor to incorporate interpretive elements. They are placemakers, that define the neighborhood and represent the historical and cultural importance of the East Village. The interpretive elements can consist of signage, information panels, or cultural objects, such as the Bob Sinclair artifacts. They can be stand-alone pieces or incorporated in landscape, hardscape, gateway elements or art. The elements will be labeled with signage, to provide interest and value to the promenade.
        </p>

        <h3>A Sustainable Green Street</h3>
        <p>
          Consistent with its designation as a Green Street, the 14th Street Promenade is oriented toward pedestrian uses with traffic-calming measures and enhanced planting. The design will further the Centre City Green program, which emphasizes the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Transform downtown streets into places for people and not just for cars
          </li>
          <li>
            Create healthier outdoor spaces that are more pedestrian- and bike-friendly, add more greenery, accommodate transit, use less energy and water, improve air quality and reduce storm water pollution  
          </li>
          <li>
            Devote less of the street right-of-way to vehicles and instead widen sidewalks
          </li>
          <li>
            Where possible, incorporate low-impact development (LID) features that include storm water management systems
          </li>
          <li>
            Use local and regional materials with high recycled content and energy-efficient pedestrian lighting.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In addition, the 14th Street Promenade will utilize bioswales and porous paving to capture storm water from the roadway, sidewalks and rooftops of adjacent buildings. The bioswales will be planted with plant material appropriate for this condition and will be a prominent attractive feature of the 14th Street Promenade. Opportunity also exists for including interpretive elements within the bioswales to help the pedestrians appreciate the importance of stormwater quality.
        </p>
